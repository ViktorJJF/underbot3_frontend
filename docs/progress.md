# Progress - Underbot3 Frontend

## What works
- Basic project structure with Vue 3, Vite, and TypeScript.
- Vuex store modular organization.
- UI library (Element Plus) and charts (ECharts) integrated.
- Memory Bank initialized.
- `lodash` dependency installed and resolved.
- Vite build successful.

## What's left to build
- Investigate `vue-tsc` failure in build script.
- Implement/Verify core features (betting, matches, teams, auth).

## Current Status
- **Development Server**: Should be functional now (Vite build passed).
- **Memory Bank**: Up to date.

## Known Issues
- `vue-tsc` fails with "Search string not found" error during build script.
